# Fullstack Task Manager (MERN)



# Overview
The Cloud-Based Task Manager is a web application designed to streamline team task management. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), this platform provides a user-friendly interface for efficient task assignment, tracking, and collaboration. The application caters to administrators and regular users, offering comprehensive features to enhance productivity and organization.



### Why/Problem?
In a dynamic work environment, effective task management is crucial for team success. Traditional methods of task tracking through spreadsheets or manual systems can be cumbersome and prone to errors. The Cloud-Based Task Manager aims to address these challenges by providing a centralized platform for task management, enabling seamless collaboration and improved workflow efficiency.
